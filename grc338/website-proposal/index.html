            <p>As much as we want to find homes for these wonderful cats quickly, we need to make sure they are going to be in good hands for the rest of their life.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>If you are interested in adopting, the first step to take is to fill out an interest form with the specified cat you would like to adopt.</li>
                <li>After we review your application, we will schedule a video or in-person interview with you to get to know you better.</li>
                <li>If the interview goes well&mdash;purrfect! We will prepare your newly adopted cat to be picked up the following week. Often times, our resident cats bond and need time to say goodbye.</li>
